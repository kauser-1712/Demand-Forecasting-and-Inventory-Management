# Demand-Forecasting-and-Inventory-Management
**Forecasting Future Demand:** Employing time series analysis techniques to predict the future demand for Product_ID: P1 accurately.

**Generating Precise Predictions:** Providing precise predictions for forthcoming days to facilitate effective resource allocation, inventory management, and production planning.

**Implementing Safety Stock Levels:** Calculating and integrating safety stock levels to address demand variability and uncertainties, ensuring sufficient inventory coverage to meet customer needs.

**Determining Reorder Point:** Identifying the reorder point, which signals when inventory replenishment should occur based on forecasted demand and safety stock levels, thereby avoiding stockouts and optimizing inventory levels.

**Optimizing Order Quantity:** Applying the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) concept to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs, striking a balance between meeting demand and reducing carrying costs.

**Defining Reorder Cycle:** Establishing the reorder cycle, representing the interval between placing orders, to streamline procurement processes and maintain optimal inventory levels throughout the supply chain.
